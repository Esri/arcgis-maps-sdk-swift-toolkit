   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

***REMOVED***  "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

***REMOVED***  "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
***REMOVED***  other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
***REMOVED***  control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

***REMOVED***  "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
***REMOVED***  including but not limited to software source code, documentation
***REMOVED***  source, and configuration files.

***REMOVED***  "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
***REMOVED***  transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
***REMOVED***  not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
***REMOVED***  and conversions to other media types.

***REMOVED***  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
***REMOVED***  Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
***REMOVED***  copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
***REMOVED***  (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

***REMOVED***  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
***REMOVED***  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
***REMOVED***  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
***REMOVED***  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
***REMOVED***  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
***REMOVED***  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
***REMOVED***  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

***REMOVED***  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
***REMOVED***  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
***REMOVED***  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
***REMOVED***  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
***REMOVED***  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
***REMOVED***  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
***REMOVED***  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
***REMOVED***  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
***REMOVED***  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
***REMOVED***  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
***REMOVED***  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
***REMOVED***  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
***REMOVED***  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

***REMOVED***  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
***REMOVED***  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
***REMOVED***  subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
***REMOVED***  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
***REMOVED***  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
***REMOVED***  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
***REMOVED***  publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
***REMOVED***  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
***REMOVED***  this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
***REMOVED***  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
***REMOVED***  (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
***REMOVED***  use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
***REMOVED***  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
***REMOVED***  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
***REMOVED***  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
***REMOVED***  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
***REMOVED***  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
***REMOVED***  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
***REMOVED***  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
***REMOVED***  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
***REMOVED***  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
***REMOVED***  as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
***REMOVED***  Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
***REMOVED***  modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
***REMOVED***  meet the following conditions:

***REMOVED***  (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

***REMOVED***  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  stating that You changed the files; and

***REMOVED***  (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  the Derivative Works; and

***REMOVED***  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
***REMOVED******REMOVED***  as modifying the License.

***REMOVED***  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
***REMOVED***  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
***REMOVED***  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
***REMOVED***  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
***REMOVED***  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
***REMOVED***  the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
***REMOVED***  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
***REMOVED***  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
***REMOVED***  this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
***REMOVED***  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
***REMOVED***  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
***REMOVED***  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
***REMOVED***  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
***REMOVED***  except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
***REMOVED***  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
***REMOVED***  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
***REMOVED***  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
***REMOVED***  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
***REMOVED***  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
***REMOVED***  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
***REMOVED***  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
***REMOVED***  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
***REMOVED***  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
***REMOVED***  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
***REMOVED***  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
***REMOVED***  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
***REMOVED***  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
***REMOVED***  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
***REMOVED***  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
***REMOVED***  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
***REMOVED***  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
***REMOVED***  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
***REMOVED***  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
***REMOVED***  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
***REMOVED***  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
***REMOVED***  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
***REMOVED***  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
***REMOVED***  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
***REMOVED***  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
***REMOVED***  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
***REMOVED***  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
***REMOVED***  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
