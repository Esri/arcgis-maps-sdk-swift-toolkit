import Combine

***REMOVED***/ A very basic data model class containing a Scene. Since a `Scene` is not an observable object,
***REMOVED***/ clients can use `SceneDataModel` as an example of how you would store a scene in a data model
***REMOVED***/ class. The class inherits from `ObservableObject` and the `Scene` is defined as a @Published
***REMOVED***/ property. This allows SwiftUI views to be updated automatically when a new scene is set on the model.
***REMOVED***/ Being stored in the model also prevents the scene from continually being created during redraws.
***REMOVED***/ The data model class would be expanded upon in client code to contain other properties required
***REMOVED***/ for the model.
class SceneDataModel: ObservableObject {
***REMOVED******REMOVED***/ The `Scene` used for display in a `SceneView`.
***REMOVED***@Published var scene: ArcGIS.Scene
