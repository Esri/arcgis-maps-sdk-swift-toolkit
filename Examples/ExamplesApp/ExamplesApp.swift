         Use of Esri location services, including basemaps and geocoding, requires either an ArcGIS identity or an API Key. For more information see https://links.esri.com/arcgis-maps-sdk-security-auth.
         1) ArcGIS identity: An ArcGIS named user account that is a member of an organization in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise.
         2) API key: A permanent key that gives your application access to Esri location services. Create a new API key or access existing API keys from your ArcGIS for Developers dashboard (https://links.esri.com/arcgis-api-keys).
         Production deployment of applications built with ArcGIS Maps SDK requires you to license ArcGIS Maps SDK functionality. For more information see https://links.esri.com/arcgis-maps-sdk-license-and-deploy.
