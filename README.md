[![doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/Doc-purple)](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/)  [![SPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPM-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/)

The ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift Toolkit contains components that will simplify your Swift app development. It is built off of the new ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift.

To use Toolkit in your project:

* **[Install with Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)** - Add `https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit` as the package repository URL.

## Toolkit Components

* **[Authenticator](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/authenticator)** - Displays a user interface when network and ArcGIS authentication challenges occur.
* **[BasemapGallery](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/basemapgallery)** - Displays a collection of basemaps.
* **[Bookmarks](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/bookmarks)** - Shows bookmarks, from a map, scene, or a list.
* **[Compass](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/compass)** - Shows a compass direction when the map is rotated. Auto-hides when the map points north.
* **[FeatureFormView](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/featureformview)** - Enables users to edit field values of a feature using pre-configured forms.
* **[FloatingPanel](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/floatingpanel)** - Allows display of view-related content in a "bottom sheet". 
* **[FloorFilter](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/floorfilter)** - Allows filtering of floor plan data in a geo view by a site, a building in the site, or a floor in the building.
* **[FlyoverSceneView](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/flyoversceneview)** - Allows you to explore a scene using your device as a window into the virtual world.
* **[JobManager](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/jobmanager)** - Manages saving and loading jobs so that they can continue to run if the app is backgrounded or even terminated by the system.
* **[OverviewMap](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/overviewmap)** - Displays the visible extent of a geo view in a small "inset" map.
* **[PopupView](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/popupview)** - Displays details, media, and attachments of features and graphics.
* **[Scalebar](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/scalebar)** - Displays current scale reference.
* **[SearchView](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/searchview)** - Displays a search experience for geo views.
* **[TableTopSceneView](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/tabletopsceneview)** - Allows you to anchor scene content to a physical surface, as if it were a 3D-printed model.
* **[UtilityNetworkTrace](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/utilitynetworktrace)** - Runs traces on a web map published with a utility network and trace configurations.
* **[WorldScaleSceneView](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/documentation/arcgistoolkit/worldscalesceneview)** - Allows you to integrate scene content with the real world.

## Requirements
* ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift
* The [System Requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/system-requirements/system-requirements-for-200-5/) are the same as those for the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift

## Instructions

### Swift Package Manager

1. Open your Xcode project. In the menu bar, select **File** > **Add Packages...** 
1. In the search bar, enter `https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit` as the package repository URL. 
1. Optionally, select an option for the **Dependency Rule** if you want to specify an exact version or a range of versions to use.   
1. Click **Add Package**.
1. Add `import ArcGIS` and `import ArcGISToolkit` in your source code and start using the toolkit components.

 Note: The Toolkit Swift Package adds the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift Package as a dependency so there's no need to add both separately. If you already have the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift Package, delete it and just add the Toolkit Swift Package.

## Configure API Key & Licensing

Use of ArcGIS location services, such as basemap styles, geocoding, and routing services, requires either user authentication or API key authentication. Some of the toolkit components and examples utilize a set of these ready-to-use ArcGIS location services, including basemap styles, and therefore require an API Key to be set in `ExamplesApp.swift`. Please see [Get started](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/get-started/#3-get-an-access-token), [Create an API Key](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/security-and-authentication/api-key-authentication/tutorials/create-an-api-key/) and [API Key Authentication](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/security-and-authentication/#api-key-authentication) for more information.

Production deployment of applications built with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift requires that you license your app. For more information, see [License and deployment](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/license-and-deployment).
