/// A scalebar displays the representation of an accurate linear measurement on the map. It provides
/// a visual indication through which users can determine the size of features or the distance
/// between features on a map. A scale bar is a line or bar divided into parts. It is labeled with
/// its ground length, usually in multiples of map units, such as tens of kilometers or hundreds of
/// miles.
///
/// ![An image of a map with a Scalebar overlaid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3998072/203605457-df6f845c-9245-4608-a61e-6d1e2e63a81b.png)
///
/// **Features**
///
/// - Can be configured to display as either a bar or line, with different styles for each.
/// - Can be configured with custom colors for fills, lines, shadows, and text.
/// - Can be configured to automatically hide after a pan or zoom operation.
/// - Displays both metric and imperial units.
///
/// **Behavior**
///
/// The scalebar uses geodetic calculations to provide accurate measurements for maps of any
/// spatial reference. The measurement is accurate for the center of the map extent being displayed.
/// This means at smaller scales (zoomed way out) you might find it somewhat inaccurate at the
/// extremes of the visible extent. As the map is panned and zoomed, the scalebar automatically
/// grows and shrinks and updates its measurement based on the new map extent.
///
/// **Associated Types**
///
/// Scalebar has the following associated types:
///
/// - ``ScalebarSettings``
/// - ``ScalebarStyle``
/// - ``ScalebarUnits``
///
/// To see it in action, try out the [Examples](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit/tree/main/Examples/Examples)
/// and refer to [ScalebarExampleView.swift](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit/blob/main/Examples/Examples/ScalebarExampleView.swift) 
/// in the project. To learn more about using the `Scalebar` see the <doc:ScalebarTutorial>.
