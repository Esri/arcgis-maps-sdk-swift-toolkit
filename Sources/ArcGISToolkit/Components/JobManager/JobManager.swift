/// An object that manages saving and loading jobs so that they can continue to run if the
/// app is backgrounded or even terminated.
///
/// The job manager is not instantiable, you must use the ``shared`` instance.
///
/// **Background**
///
/// Jobs are long running server operations. When a job instance is started on the client,
/// it makes a request to a service asking it to start work on the server. At that point, the client
/// polls the server intermittently to check the status of the work. Once the work is completed
/// the result is downloaded with a background `URLSession`. This allows the download to
/// complete out of process, and the download task can relaunch the app upon completion, even
/// in the case where the app was terminated.
///
/// We do not expect users to keep an application in the foreground and wait for a job to complete.
/// Once the job is started, if the app is backgrounded, we can use an app refresh
/// background task to check the status of the work on the server. If the server work is complete
/// we can start downloading the result in the background at that point. If the work on the server
/// is not complete, we can reschedule another background app refresh to recheck status.
///
/// There is some iOS behavior to be aware of as well. In iOS, if an application is backgrounded,
/// the operating system can terminate the app at its discretion. This means that jobs need to be
/// serialized when an app is backgrounded so that if the app is terminated the jobs can be
/// rehydrated upon relaunch of the app.
///
/// Also, in iOS, if the user of an app removes the app from the multitasking UI (aka force quits it),
/// the system interprets this as a strong indication that the app should
/// do no more work in the background. The consequences of this are two-fold for jobs.
/// One, any background fetch tasks are not given any time until the app is relaunched again.
/// And two, any background downloads that are in progress are canceled by the operating system.
///
/// **Features**
///
/// The job manager is an `ObservableObject` with a mutable ``jobs`` property. Adding a job to this
/// property will allow the job manager to do the work to make sure that we can rehydrate a job
/// if an app is terminated.
///
/// As such, the job manager will:
///
///  - Serialize the job to the user defaults when the app is backgrounded
///  - Deserialize the job when an application is relaunched
///
/// The job manager will help with the lifetime of jobs in other ways as well.
///
/// The job manager will ask the system for some background processing time when an app
/// is backgrounded so that jobs that are not yet started on the server, can have some time to
/// allow them to start. This means if you kick off a job and it hasn't actually started on the server
/// when the app is backgrounded, the job should have enough time to start on the server which
/// will cause it to enter into a polling state. When the job reaches the polling state the
/// status of the work on the server can be checked intermittently.
///
/// To enable polling while an app is backgrounded, the job manager will request from the system a
/// background refresh task (if enabled via the ``JobManager/preferredBackgroundStatusCheckSchedule``
/// property). If the system later executes the background refresh task then the
/// job manager will check the status of any running jobs. At that point the jobs may start
/// downloading their result. Note, this does not work on the simulator, this behavior can only
/// be tested on an actual device.
///
/// Now that the job can check status in the background, it can start downloading in the background.
/// By default, jobs will download their results with background URL session. This means that the
/// download can execute out of process, even if the app is terminated. If the app is terminated and
/// then later relaunched by the system because a background downloaded completed, then you may
/// call the ``JobManager/resumeAllPausedJobs()`` method from the application relaunch point,
/// which will correlate the jobs to their respective downloads that completed and the jobs will
/// then finish. The app relaunch point can happen via the SwiftUI modifier `.backgroundTask(.urlSession(...))`.
/// In UIKit it would be the `UIApplicationDelegate` method `func application(UIApplication, handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession: String, completionHandler: () -> Void)`
/// - Since: 200.3
