/// The `Bookmarks` component will display a list of bookmarks and allow the user to select a
/// bookmark and perform some action. You can create the component with either an array of
/// `Bookmark` values, or with a `Map` or `Scene` containing the bookmarks to display.
///
/// `Bookmarks` can be configured to handle automated bookmark selection (zooming the map/scene to
/// the bookmarkâ€™s viewpoint) by passing in a `Viewpoint` binding or the client can handle bookmark
/// selection changes manually using ``onSelectionChanged(perform:)``.

///
/// **Features**
///
/// - Can be configured to display bookmarks from a map or scene, or from an array of user-defined
/// bookmarks.
/// - Can be configured to automatically zoom the map or scene to a bookmark selection.
/// - Can be configured to perform a user-defined action when a bookmark is selected.
/// - Will automatically hide when a bookmark is selected.
///
/// **Behavior**
/// 
/// If a `Viewpoint` binding is provided to the `Bookmarks` view, selecting a bookmark will set that
/// viewpoint binding to the viewpoint of the bookmark. Selecting a bookmark will dismiss the
/// `Bookmarks` view. If a `GeoModel` is provided, that geo model's bookmarks will be displayed to
/// the user.
///
/// To see it in action, try out the [Examples](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit/tree/main/Examples/Examples)
/// and refer to [BookmarksExampleView.swift](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-maps-sdk-swift-toolkit/blob/main/Examples/Examples/BookmarksExampleView.swift)
/// in the project. To learn more about using the `Bookmarks` component see the [Bookmarks Tutorial](https://developers.arcgis.com/swift/toolkit-api-reference/tutorials/arcgistoolkit/bookmarkstutorial).
