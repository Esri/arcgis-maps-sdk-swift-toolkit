/// The `Bookmarks` component will display a list of bookmarks and allow the user to select a
/// bookmark and perform some action. You can create the component with either an array of
/// `Bookmarks`, or with a `Map` or `Scene` containing the bookmarks to display.
///
/// `Bookmarks` can be configured to handle automated bookmark selection (zooming the map/scene to
/// the bookmarkâ€™s viewpoint) by passing in a `Viewpoint` binding or the client can handle bookmark
/// selection changes manually using ``onSelectionChanged(perform:)``.
///
/// If a `Viewpoint` binding is provided to the `Bookmarks` view, selecting a bookmark will set that
/// viewpoint binding to the viewpoint of the bookmark. Selecting a bookmark will dismiss the
/// `Bookmarks` view. If a `GeoModel` is provided, that geo model's bookmarks will be displayed to
/// the user.
