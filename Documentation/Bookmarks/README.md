# Bookmarks

The Bookmarks component will display a list of bookmarks and allows the user to select a bookmark and perform some action. You can create the component with either an array of `Bookmarks`, or with a `Map` or `Scene` containing the bookmarks to display.

The component can be configured to handle automated bookmark selection (zooming the map/scene to the bookmarkâ€™s viewpoint) by passing in a `Viewpoint` binding or the client can handle bookmark selection changes manually using the `.onSelectionChanged(perform:)` modifier.

## Bookmarks Behavior:

## Usage

```swift
// Display bookmarks in a map, passing in a viewpoint binding to allow
// automated bookmark selection.
Bookmarks(
    isPresented: $showingBookmarks,
    mapOrScene: map,
    viewpoint: $viewpoint
)
```

```swift
// Handle bookmark selection changes manually using `.onSelectionChanged(perform:)`.
Bookmarks(
    isPresented: $showingBookmarks,
    mapOrScene: map,
    viewpoint: $viewpoint
)
.onSelectionChanged {
    print("New bookmark: \($0.name)")
}

```
