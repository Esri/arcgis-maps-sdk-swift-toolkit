# Compass

The Compass (alias North arrow) displays the current viewpoint rotation of a MapView or SceneView. The Compass supports resetting the rotation to zero/north.

The ArcGIS Maps SDK for Swift currently supports rotating MapViews and SceneViews interactively with a 2-finger gesture and while the map/scene will snap to north when rotating using gestures, the Compass provides an easier way. The Compass Toolkit component will appear when the map is rotated and, when tapped, re-orientates the map back to north and hides the compass icon (note that the MapView auto-snaps back to north when it's within a threshold of north, and in that case the compass also auto hides).

## Features

Compass:

- Automatically hides when the rotation is zero.
- Can be configured to be always visible.
- Will reset the map/scene rotation to North when tapped on.

## Key properties

`Compass` has the following initializers:

```swift
    /// Creates a compass with a rotation (0째 indicates a direction toward true North, 90째 indicates
    /// a direction toward true West, etc.).
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - rotation: The rotation whose value determines the heading of the compass.
    ///   - mapViewProxy: The proxy to provide access to map view operations.
    public init(rotation: Double?, mapViewProxy: MapViewProxy)
    
    /// Creates a compass with a rotation (0째 indicates a direction toward true North, 90째 indicates
    /// a direction toward true West, etc.).
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - rotation: The rotation whose value determines the heading of the compass.
    ///   - action: The action to perform when the compass is tapped.
    public init(rotation: Double?, action: @escaping () -> Void)
```

`Compass` has the following modifiers:

- `func compassSize(size: CGFloat)` - The size of the `Compass`, specifying both the width and height of the compass.
- `func autoHideDisabled(_:)` - Specifies whether the ``Compass`` should automatically hide when the heading is 0.

## Behavior:

Whenever the map is not orientated North (non-zero bearing) the compass appears. When reset to north, it disappears. The `autoHideDisabled` view modifier allows you to disable the auto-hide feature so that it is always displayed.

When the compass is tapped, the map orients back to north (zero bearing). 

## Usage

### Basic usage for displaying a `Compass`.

```swift
@State private var map = Map(basemapStyle: .arcGISImagery)

@State private var viewpoint: Viewpoint?

var body: some View {
    MapViewReader { proxy in
        MapView(map: map, viewpoint: viewpoint)
            .onViewpointChanged(kind: .centerAndScale) { viewpoint = $0 }
            .overlay(alignment: .topTrailing) {
                Compass(rotation: viewpoint?.rotation, mapViewProxy: proxy)
                    .padding()
            }
    }
}
```

To add a `Compass` to a SceneView, use the initializer which takes an `action` argument to perform a custom action when the compass is tapped on.

```swift
@State private var scene = Scene(basemapStyle: .arcGISImagery)

@State private var viewpoint: Viewpoint?

var body: some View {
    SceneViewReader { proxy in
        SceneView(scene: scene)
            .onViewpointChanged(kind: .centerAndScale) { viewpoint = $0 }
            .overlay(alignment: .topTrailing) {
                Compass(rotation: viewpoint?.rotation) {
                    if let viewpoint {
                        Task {
                            await proxy.setViewpoint(viewpoint.withRotation(.zero))
                        }
                    }
                }
                .padding()
            }
    }
}
```
