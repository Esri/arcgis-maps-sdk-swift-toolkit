# FloatingPanel

A floating panel is a view that overlays a view and supplies view-related content. For a map view, for instance, it could display a legend, bookmarks, search results, etc.. Apple Maps, Google Maps, Windows 10, and Collector have floating panel implementations, sometimes referred to as a "bottom sheet".

Floating panels are non-modal and primarily simple containers that clients will fill with their own content. They can be transient where they only display information for a short period of time, like identify results. Or they can be persistent, where the information is always displayed. A dedicated search panel, for example.
