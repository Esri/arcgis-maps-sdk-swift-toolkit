# FloatingPanel

A floating panel is a view that overlays a view and supplies view-related content. For a map view, for instance, it could display a legend, bookmarks, search results, etc.. Apple Maps, Google Maps, Windows 10, and Collector have floating panel implementations, sometimes referred to as a "bottom sheet".

Floating panels are non-modal and can be transient, only displaying information for a short period of time like identify results, or persistent, where the information is always displayed, for example a dedicated search panel. They will also be primarily simple containers that clients will fill with their own content.
